There are two types of data types in JavaScrip. 
1. Primitive
2. Non-primitive.

Primitive Types (Value Types):
- Number: Represents numeric values, including integers and floating-point numbers.
- String: Represents text, enclosed in single (') or double (") quotes.
- Boolean: Represents a logical value indicating true or false.
- undefined: Represents a variable that has been declared but not assigned a value.
- null: Represents the intentional absence of any object value.
- Symbol: Represents a unique identifier, introduced in ES6.

Non-primitive Types (Reference Types):
- Objects: Represents a collection of key-value pairs, where keys are strings (or Symbols) and values can be any JavaScript data type.
- Functions: Represents reusable blocks of code that can be called.
- Arrays: Special type of object used to store multiple values in a single variable, accessed with numeric indices.
